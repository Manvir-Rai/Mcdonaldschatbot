# Mcdonaldschatbot
A Telegram-based McDonalds Chatbot

The bot is also able to run on any device and operating system capable of running telegram (Desktop, mobile - MacOS, IOS, Windows etc.). 

Link to the bot: https://t.me/mcdonaldsprojectbot

For the bot to be operational constantly, it must be hosted. It can be hosted for free using Replit (Copy and paste code, then hit run - code running = bot running) - you may need to install the pyTelegramBotApi package first on replit, for the bot to function.


You are free to copy this bot and do as you wish with it - it is open source (... as you can see) so we do not mind. 


This bot was created for our group project @ Coventry Univeristy. Created by team chocolate: Manvir, Tariq, Ayuub, Hamza.
